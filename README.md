Majestic Thai - An Amazing Project
====================
When my instructor assigned this homework project over a long weekend, I was ecstatic. After all, I lived in Thailand and it always pains me to pay $15 at a Thai joint in America for a dish I used to eat on the street for less than a dollar. So don't be alarmed when you notice all the prices are listed in Thai Baht, as I promise the food is up to par and - Thai fare or not - now I'm ready to help any restaurant accept orders from their website!
